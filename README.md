  - From the data set, I indentify the purchase frequency of customers to promptly launch marketing campaigns to retain customers, find out the products that customers buy the most. Beside, I will discover the most valuable customer segment to redistribute the company's resources and get more return on investment. K-means clustering algorithm is a great tool for that.
